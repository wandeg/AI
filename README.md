I'm going to use this as a test bed for all AI/ Machine Learning related applications I write.

It's an app engiene project initially written in webapp2
The biggest challenge so far has been having to rewrite some libs to use urlfetch instead of urllib2, requests etc because of app engine
I'm seriously reconsidering the wisdom in using app engine because of  this
